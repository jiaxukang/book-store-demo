Update sql database in BookShopDemo/DataStructure

# Introduction

Open website, you should register a account, then login.

You can see three books here, then click order button to order, every book has only one. After you order, jump to my order page to check your unique order.

Then the book account is zero, when other user want to order, it jump to main page and not create a order.

I think a pop-up should appear when a user wants to order a book that is not in stock. This is one point i need to review it.

And you can go to localhost/books/Index to edit the book information instead of changing database.

# Function
